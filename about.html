        <p class="about-text">
            Hi! My name’s Isabel, and I’ve been immersed in the arts since I was in the 6th grade. Growing up in an art-focused environment shaped me into someone with a deep appreciation for exploring different forms of media. My creative journey started with photography—I spent a few years honing my eye for capturing moments. Then, I shifted my focus to graphic design, where I found joy in creating visually compelling works.

        <p class="about-text">
            Eventually, my passion for storytelling and interactive experiences led me to video games. I was captivated by the idea of creating my own game, but for a long time, I felt intimidated by coding. It seemed like this massive, complex world I wasn’t sure I could navigate. Over time, though, I started to pick up the basics, and now I love using coding to bring my creative ideas to life.
